  <p>This online workshop will be unlike any other workshop you’ve experienced. We call it an intensive
    because,
    well, it’s intense. </p>
  <p>
    In five 90-minute sessions, you’ll join Jared Spool on a comprehensive exploration to develop your team’s
    own
    Outcome-Driven UX Metrics. You’ll complete your journey with metrics that your stakeholders won’t ignore.
  </p>
  <p>Your metrics’ targets will capture the attention of your stakeholders and executives, raising the
    importance
    of UX within the organization. Your definition of project success will inspire your organization to
    deliver
    better-designed products and services.</p>
  <p>Each day, from Monday, February 6, through Friday, February 10, you’ll attend a 90-minute session
    containing
    a new aspect of Outcome-Driven UX Metrics. </p>
  <p>
    You can choose between the 2pm ET (19.00 GMT) or 7pm ET (24.00 GMT) sessions. Jared
    will be at both to
    guide
    you through the fundamentals and answer your questions.
  </p>
  <p>Here’s what’s happening during the Intensive’s Fundamentals week:</p>
