            UX Metrics are the cornerstone of a strong UX strategy
          </h2>

          <h3> Few UX leaders realize how important having the right UX metrics is</h3>

          <p>
            Too many teams treat metrics as an afterthought. UX leaders try to use metrics to show the effectiveness of
            their teams’ efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interestingly, the most successful UX leaders treat their metrics quite differently.
          </p>
          <p>
            These leaders use their UX metrics as the ticket out of their organization’s reactive "feature factory"
            approach. Through metrics, they increase collaboration with their product and development peers. In
            addition, they promote better experiences as a top-level organizational goal, not just a nice-to-have
            achievement for the UX team.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this intensive, you’ll explore what these successful UX leaders have discovered. You’ll uncover the power
            of having UX metrics so strong that your stakeholders won’t ignore them.
          </p>
          <h3>The most successful leaders tell their story using UX metrics</h3>
          <p>Successful UX leaders use UX metrics to tell a story.</p>
          <ul class="width80 center">
            <li>The story of the UX journey the organization is on</li>
            <li>The story of where they started on this journey</li>
            <li>The story of where they’re trying to get to</li>
            <li>The story of the progress they’ve made</li>
            <li>The story of the obstacles ahead</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Effective UX metrics are how these UX leaders promote great UX throughout the organization. The metrics are
            how the leaders influence important design decisions, like which functionality should be built next. The UX
            metrics explain what success for new releases should look like.
          </p>
          <p>Their stories must connect the metrics to the organization’s most essential objectives.</p>
          <p>
            There’s no magic here. <br /> Just simple-to-understand metrics.</p>

            Outcome-Driven UX Metrics: a unique approach to measuring the user experience
          </h2>


          <h3>Conventional metrics focus on the wrong things
          </h3>

          <p>
            Too many UX leaders think of UX metrics as a separate discipline within UX, unrelated to the day-to-day
            work. Some leaders don’t think metrics are essential to their teams’ work.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve met leaders who have split "quantitative UX research" into its own function, often putting the "quant
            people" into a separate group. These leaders have a tools-first approach, where they start their metrics
            efforts by surveying what the available tools and instruments can tell them.

          </p>
          <p>
            These leaders end up with a mish-mash of charts and reports, but they have no way to connect them to the
            experiences of the users and customers. They reinforce the cycle that metrics aren’t that important to UX
            and only are needed when executives insist on them.
          </p>
          <p>The problem with the conventional approach is that it measures the wrong things. The tools and instruments
            measure the behaviors of users. They don’t measure what’s truly important: the user's experience with your
            products or services.</p>
          <h5>Measuring the users’ experiences, not their behaviors</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome-Driven UX Metrics</strong> is our unique approach to measuring the users’ experiences. It’s
            not based on
            the magical thinking that you find in conventional UX metrics approaches. Instead, it’s driven by the most
            important outcomes for your users.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll start with a simple question: <em>How will you improve your users’ lives?</em> You’ll build your
            metrics
            completely around this question.
          </p>
          <p>We’re not starting with the analytics reports. Instead, we begin with the UX professional’s most powerful
            instrument: our keen observation. </p>
          <p>Everything you can observe can be measured. You build your Outcome-Driven UX Metrics from what you see when
            you study your users’ and customers’ experiences. </p>
          <p>Based on your observations, you determine what an improved user experience would look like. That becomes
            your <em>UX success metric.</em> </p>
          <p>
            Then you identify what the journey is to achieving that success. The milestones along the way are your
            <em>UX
              progress metrics.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Are there obstacles in your way? You can describe those challenges with <em>problem-value
              metrics.</em></p>
          <p>Each of these metrics categories helps you tell your UX journey’s story. The story of where you’re going,
            where you started, and how far along you are.</p>
          <p>Outcome-Driven UX Metrics are simple in their concepts. Once you acquire the fundamentals, you’re ready to
            implement your own. </p>
          <p>And once you implement your own Outcome-Driven UX Metrics, you’ve unleashed a superpower. You’ll spark
            exceptional outcomes with your UX metrics as the foundation.</p>

        <p><em>Roll up your sleeves and plan to get to work.</em></p>
        <p>There won’t be fake companies to create over-simplified metrics for. Nothing here will be "practice."</p>
        <p>Instead, you’ll be doing the actual work of crafting your team’s UX metrics. You’ll create
          industrial-strength metrics that will capture the attention of your executives and stakeholders.</p>
        <p>You’ll use your <strong>Outcome-Driven UX Metrics workbook</strong> to guide your efforts. Then, you’ll start
          applying
          everything you learn right away.</p>
        <p>
          You’ll come away from the intensive with your own custom set of metrics. Bring your team in on the process,
          and you’ll have even better results.
        </p>
        <p>Might miss a session? No worries. We’ll be recording everything, so you can catch up on anything you miss.
        </p>
        <p>You’ll have questions. We’re ready for that. The sessions are each 90 minutes, so we should have plenty of
          time. </p>
        <p>And we’ll ensure you have the confidence you need to do this right. We have created a dedicated private area
          in our <em>Leaders of Awesomeness</em> community. Put your questions there for Jared and the community to
          share their
          thoughts. </p>
        <p>Discuss the gnarliest of challenges, and you’ll come away with all the assurance you need that you’ve got
          this.</p>

          <p>His experience, working with design leaders of organizations like IBM, NASA, GE, Fidelity
